In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) in MySQL. The project entailed understanding and uncovering patterns from a data set collected from a retail business. The EDA process is broken down into data collection, which includes importing CSV files from external sources using MySQL. The second process entailed data cleaning to ensure the data was free of errors and inconsistencies. Data analysis was the third step and entailed SQL queries to explore the data, joining tables, and exporting the data for visualization in Tableau
